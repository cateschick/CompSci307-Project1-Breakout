### Timeline

Start Date: August 27th, 2021

Finish Date: September 6th, 2021

Hours Spent: 30 hours

### Tutorial and other Resources Used

I looked through the Oracle documentation to help me with Circles, Rectangles, and Text
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/toc.htm

I looked at a stackoverflow article to figure out how to end my game when a player won or lost
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42598097/using-javafx-application-stop-method-over-shutdownhook

I referenced the Refactoring reading from this week's readings

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: N/A

Key/Mouse inputs:
My program responds to key inputs for left and right movements. The paddle moves horizontally based 
on which direction the user indicates.

Known Bugs:

### Notes/Assumptions
For the revision aspect of this project, I worked on refactoring my main method into classes
for the Paddle, Ball, and Brick objects. This makes my code more readable and more adaptable to potential changes
that I will make moving forward.

### Impressions
I really liked this project! I think it will be fun to add more levels, brick configurations, etc.
I think this is a project I can touch up more in the next few weeks and add to my resume.
